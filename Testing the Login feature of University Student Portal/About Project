This project is a part of my class assignment in Quality Assurance and Automation class (CS 522) at Northwestern Polytechnic University.
1) Create a xlsx sheet with multiple rows and columns data (e.g. Username and dummy password etc.) 
2) create a Java Selenium WebDriver test case using TestNG framework to test NPU student login to drive data line by line from a xlsx sheet and write data (running result) to the xlsx sheet 
3) Using as much as function method calls 
4) Using TestNG annotations @BeforeTest, @AfterTest, @BeforeMethod, @AfterMethod and @Test 
5) Using your First Name + “ “ + Last Name as “username” and your student id as “Password” when you submit homework 
(you can use your or your team member’s login name and password to debug) 
 
You should submit a zip files including one xlsx (data), one automation test case (java) and one test-output report file (html)
