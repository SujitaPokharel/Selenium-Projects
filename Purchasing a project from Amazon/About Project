This project is a part of my class assignment in Quality Assurance and Automation class (CS 522) at Northwestern Polytechnic University.
We had team of two members. My team mate basically did the documentation and presentation part. I did the coding part.
Here we have designed a program which will find out the product we want to search (eg iWatch here) and adds to carts, checks out and thus completes the order process.
We have used excel sheet to provide all the necessary informations(credentials)
You might notice that our report shows that the test case failed. Its because I didnt used my real card number to buy product. However, it works when I tried to buy inexpensive product using the same app.
